This is a simple Makefile that implements everything one needs to customize
Ubuntu/Debian based LiveCD.


It expects `ubuntu.iso` file and will produce `ubuntu-custom.iso`.

To use:

	sudo make <target>

The target may be:

* `enter` - will put you into a chroot shell with extracted cd as environment
  that you can edit
* `iso` (the default) - will build the `ubuntu-custom.iso` cd from what you've
  edited
* `test` - will try to run that CD using qemu for you to test it

The resulting `ubuntu-custom.iso` can be used in the future as a base image
(`ubuntu.iso`).
